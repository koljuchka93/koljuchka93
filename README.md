## :pushpin: Summary
Hello, I am a passionate QA professional with a strong enthusiasm for testing and playing games. I enjoy playing games and testing, so I decided to become a QA professional[^1]. I'm looking for new opportunities to broaden my experience and contribute to exciting projects.

[^1]: It was while reading the article about mob in-game on Wikipedia I first learned about the tester profession, which surprised me. For a long time, I had no idea there was such a profession as QA in Ukraine.
